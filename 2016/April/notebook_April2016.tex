\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tried to find reasonable value for the heating rate in the energy equation for the zero-D reactor.
  \item Finally got Drekar configured and compiled.  All tests, including extended tests, pass.  Errors when adding options for SUPG Energy evaluator.  Not clear what the errors are.
\end{enumerate}

\experiment{0D Reactor}
To do:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Clean up code.  Add comments and document how it works.
  \item Find reasonable heating rate values.
  \item Run heating rate calibration.
\end{enumerate}
Today I just worked on the heating rate values.

\subexperiment{Heating Rate}
Recall that the energy equation is
\begin{align}
  \odeone{T}{t} = -\dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{N}{u_{k}\lr{T}\odeone{x_{k}}{t}}}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=k}^{N}{c_{vk}x_{k}}} + Q_{T}
\end{align}
where $T$ is the temperature, $u_{k}\lr{T}$ is the internal energy of species $k$, $x_{k}$ is the molar concentration of species $k$ and $c_{vk}$ is the specific heat at constant volume of species $k$.  We have also included the heating rate $Q_{T}$ which may be a function of time or temperature.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5, colframe=blue!40!black, title=Estimate of Heating Rate]
  \begin{align*}
    Q_{T} \approx \odeone{T}{x}s_{L}
  \end{align*}
  where $s_{L}$ is the laminar flame speed.
\end{tcolorbox}

The laminar flame speed for hydrogen-air premixed flames at $\phi = 1$ is approximately $2$ m/s.  The energy equation in one dimension reduces to
\begin{align}
  \rho s_{L}\odeone{T}{x} = \odeone{}{x}\lr{\frac{\lambda}{c_{p}} \odeone{T}{x}}
\end{align}
where we assumed constant specific heat among species and no reactions.  Integrating this from $T_{u}$ to $T_{b}$ and solving for the temperature gradient gives
\begin{align}
  \odeone{T}{x} = \frac{\rho_{u}c_{p}s_{L}}{\lambda_{b}}\lr{T_{b}-T_{u}}.
\end{align}
Hence,
\begin{align}
  Q_{T} \approx \frac{\rho_{u}c_{p}s_{L}^{2}}{\lambda_{b}}\lr{T_{b}-T_{u}}.
\end{align}
If we now use some very rough values for air of $\rho_{u} = 1.225$, $c_{p} \approx 1200$ and $\lambda_{b}=0.05$ and we use $T_{b}\approx 3000$, $T_{u} = 1500$ with $s_{L}=4$ (all in SI units and temperatures in Kelvin) then $Q_{T}\approx 10^{8}$.  Note that $T_{b}$ and $T_{u}$ were taken from a simulation of the 0-D reactor without any source term.
